## Overview

- Import media from a public URL
- Configure transcription settings
- Download your transcript

## Step 1: Import from URL

<Steps>
<Step title="Sign in to your account">

Sign in to your SkyScribe account, then navigate to your [SkyScribe dashboard](https://app.sky-scribe.com/dashboard).

</Step>

<Step title="Select Fetch method">

Click on **Fetch** as your transcription method.

</Step>

<Step title="Enter media URL">

Paste the URL to the media you want to transcribe into the **Media Link** field.

<Note>
**Supported platforms:**

Import audio and video from YouTube, Dropbox, Box, Google Drive, Instagram, Vimeo, X (Twitter), TikTok, direct audio/video URLs, and dozens more platforms and services.

**Important:** The link must be publicly accessible.
</Note>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Transcribe or translate

Select how you want to process your audio:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Transcribe">

**Transcribe** converts your audio to text in the same language as the original audio. This is ideal when you want an exact written record of what was said.

**Use cases:**
- Meeting notes
- Interview transcripts
- Podcast transcriptions
- Lecture notes

</Tab>

<Tab title="Translate">

**Translate** converts your audio to text in a different language. The audio will be transcribed and then translated into your target language.

**Use cases:**
- Translating foreign language content
- Creating multilingual subtitles
- International content localization

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: Select language

<Tabs>
<Tab title="For Transcribe">

Choose the language of your audio file:

- **Auto-detect** (Recommended): SkyScribe will automatically detect the language spoken in your audio or video. This works best for single-language audio.
- **Manual selection**: Choose a specific language if you know what language is spoken in the audio.

<Tip>
Auto-detect is accurate for single-language audio and saves you time. Use manual selection for mixed-language audio, specialized dialects, or when you need consistent language processing.
</Tip>

<Note>
SkyScribe supports 99 languages. [View the complete language list](/guides/language-support) and performance details.
</Note>

</Tab>

<Tab title="For Translate">

Select the **target language** you want your transcript translated into. Your audio will be transcribed in its original language and then translated to your selected language.

<Note>
SkyScribe supports translation between 99 languages powered by OpenAI Whisper. [Learn more about language support](/guides/language-support).
</Note>

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 4: Speaker diarization (optional)

Speaker diarization identifies and labels different speakers in your audio. When enabled, your transcript will indicate who is speaking at each point in the conversation.

<Note>
**Example output:**
```
Speaker 1: Hello, how are you today?
Speaker 2: I'm doing great, thanks for asking.
Speaker 1: That's wonderful to hear.
```
</Note>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="When to use it">

- Multi-person interviews
- Meetings and conference calls
- Podcasts with multiple hosts
- Panel discussions

</Tab>
<Tab title="When to skip it">

- Single-speaker content (lectures, solo podcasts)
- When speaker identity doesn't matter
- Faster processing time needed

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 5: Start transcribing

Once you've configured all your settings, click the **"Transcribe"** button to start processing.

<Steps>
<Step>

SkyScribe will fetch the media from the URL and queue it for processing. You'll see a progress indicator showing the status.

</Step>

<Step>

Processing time depends on:
- Media length
- Platform download speed
- Selected settings
- Current queue size

<Tip>
Fetching from URLs may take longer than uploading files directly, especially for longer videos or slower platforms.
</Tip>

</Step>

<Step>

Visit [Transcriptions](https://app.sky-scribe.com/transcriptions) for all transcription jobs (running or complete). For each transcription, you can:
- **View or edit** your transcript in the [transcript editor](/guides/transcript-editor) to resegment, translate, clean up, and improve your transcription
- **Download** in multiple formats: PDF, DOC, TXT, MD, SRT, VTT, CSV, or JSON
- [**Share**](#) with team or public
- [Extract](#) information or generate summaries

</Step>
</Steps>
