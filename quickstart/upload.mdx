## Overview

- Upload an audio or video file

## Step 1: Upload your file

<Steps>
<Step title="Sign in to your account">

Sign in to your SkyScribe account, then navigate to your [SkyScribe dashboard](https://app.sky-scribe.com/dashboard).

</Step>

<Step title="Select Upload method">

Click on **Upload** as your transcription method.

</Step>

<Step title="Choose your file">

You can upload your audio or video file in two ways:

- **Drag and drop** your file into the upload area
- **Click the upload area** to select files from your device

<Info>

</Info>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Transcribe or translate

Select how you want to process your audio:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Transcribe">

**Transcribe** converts your audio to text in the same language as the original audio. This is ideal when you want an exact written record of what was said.

**Use cases:**
- Meeting notes
- Interview transcripts
- Podcast transcriptions
- Lecture notes

</Tab>

<Tab title="Translate">

**Translate** converts your audio to text in a different language. The audio will be transcribed and then translated into your target language.

**Use cases:**
- Translating foreign language content
- Creating multilingual subtitles
- International content localization

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: Select language

<Tabs>
<Tab title="For Transcribe">

Choose the language of your audio file:

- **Auto-detect** (Recommended): SkyScribe will automatically detect the language spoken in your audio or video. This works best for single-language audio.
- **Manual selection**: Choose a specific language if you know what language is spoken in the audio.

<Tip>
Auto-detect is accurate for single-language audio. Use manual selection for mixed-language audio, specialized dialects, or consistent language processing.
</Tip>

<Note>
SkyScribe supports 99 languages. [View the complete language list](/guides/language-support) and performance details.
</Note>

</Tab>

<Tab title="For Translate">

Select the **target language** you want your transcript translated into. Your audio will be transcribed in its original language and then translated to your selected language.

<Note>
SkyScribe supports translation between 99 languages powered by OpenAI Whisper. [Learn more about language support](/guides/language-support).
</Note>

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 4: Speaker diarization (optional)

Speaker diarization identifies and labels different speakers in your audio. When enabled, your transcript will indicate who is speaking at each point in the conversation.

<Note>
**Example output:**
```
Speaker 1: Hello, how are you today?
Speaker 2: I'm doing great, thanks for asking.
Speaker 1: That's wonderful to hear.
```
</Note>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="When to use it">

- Multi-person interviews
- Meetings and conference calls
- Podcasts with multiple hosts
- Panel discussions

</Tab>
<Tab title="When to skip it">

- Single-speaker content (lectures, solo podcasts)
- When speaker identity doesn't matter
- Faster processing time needed

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 5: Start transcribing

Once you've configured all your settings, click the **"Transcribe"** button to start processing your file.

<Steps>
<Step>

Your file will be uploaded and queued for processing. You'll see a progress indicator showing the status.

</Step>

<Step>

Processing time depends on:
- File length
- Selected settings
- Current queue size

Typical processing time is 1-2 minutes for a 30-minute file.

</Step>
