## Overview

- Record audio from your device microphone
- Configure transcription settings
- Download your transcript

## Step 1: Start recording

<Steps>
<Step title="Sign in to your account">

Sign in to your SkyScribe account, then navigate to your dashboard at [https://app.sky-scribe.com/dashboard](https://app.sky-scribe.com/dashboard).

</Step>

<Step title="Select Record method">

Click on **Record** as your transcription method.

</Step>

<Step title="Grant microphone access">

When recording for the first time, your device will ask for microphone access permission. Simply grant it and the recording interface will appear.

</Step>

<Step title="Start recording">

Click the **Record** button to start capturing audio directly from your device microphone.

<Tip>
Hit record, speak your mind, and get text back. Simple as that.
</Tip>

</Step>
</Steps>

## Step 2: Transcribe or translate

Select how you want to process your audio:

<Tabs>
<Tab title="Transcribe">

**Transcribe** converts your audio to text in the same language as the original audio. This is ideal when you want an exact written record of what was said.

**Use cases:**
- Meeting notes
- Interview transcripts
- Podcast transcriptions
- Lecture notes

</Tab>

<Tab title="Translate">

**Translate** converts your audio to text in a different language. The audio will be transcribed and then translated into your target language.

**Use cases:**
- Translating foreign language content
- Creating multilingual subtitles
- International content localization

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 3: Select language

<Tabs>
<Tab title="For Transcribe">

Choose the language of your audio file:

- **Auto-detect** (Recommended): SkyScribe will automatically detect the language spoken in your audio or video. This works best for single-language audio.
- **Manual selection**: Choose a specific language if you know what language is spoken in the audio.

<Tip>
Auto-detect is highly accurate for single-language audio and saves you time. Use manual selection for mixed-language audio, specialized dialects, or when you need consistent language processing.
</Tip>

<Note>
SkyScribe supports 99 languages. [View the complete language list](/guides/language-support) and performance details.
</Note>

</Tab>

<Tab title="For Translate">

Select the **target language** you want your transcript translated into. Your audio will be transcribed in its original language and then translated to your selected language.

<Note>
SkyScribe supports translation between 99 languages powered by OpenAI Whisper. [Learn more about language support](/guides/language-support).
</Note>

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 4: Speaker diarization (optional)

Speaker diarization identifies and labels different speakers in your audio. When enabled, your transcript will indicate who is speaking at each point in the conversation.

<Note>
**Example output:**
```
Speaker 1: Hello, how are you today?
Speaker 2: I'm doing great, thanks for asking.
Speaker 1: That's wonderful to hear.
```
</Note>

<Tabs>
<Tab title="When to use it">

- Multi-person interviews
- Meetings and conference calls
- Podcasts with multiple hosts
- Panel discussions

</Tab>
<Tab title="When to skip it">

- Single-speaker content (lectures, solo podcasts)
- When speaker identity doesn't matter
- Faster processing time needed

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 5: AI Review (optional)

AI Review adds an additional enhancement pass after your transcripts are ready. It uses advanced AI to polish and improve your transcriptions.

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Content Integrity" icon="shield-check">

Never invents content - only fixes errors while preserving timestamps

</Card>
<Card title="Remove Filler Words" icon="eraser">

Eliminates "um", "uh", "like" and adds proper capitalization and punctuation

</Card>
<Card title="Fix Typos" icon="spell-check">

Corrects transcription errors and misspellings

</Card>
<Card title="Context-Aware" icon="brain">

Identifies technical terms (e.g., "API", "Kubernetes") and improves sentence structure

</Card>
</CardGroup>

<Warning>
AI Review may add 10-20% more processing time but significantly improves transcript quality, especially for technical content or recordings with background noise.
</Warning>

## Step 6: Segmentation style (optional)

Expand the **Advanced Settings** section and choose how your transcript should be broken into segments:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Readable" icon="book">
Segments of ~30 seconds with punctuation and capitalization for easier reading.

**Best for:**

- Documents and articles
- Meeting notes
- General transcription
</Card>

<Card title="Subtitle" icon="closed-captioning">
Short, punchy segments tuned for subtitles and captions.

**Best for:**

- Video captions
- Subtitles
- Social media content
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Step 7: Finish recording

When you're done speaking, click the **Stop** button to end the recording.

<Steps>
<Step>

Your recording will be processed automatically. You'll see a progress indicator showing the transcription status.

</Step>

<Step>

Processing time depends on:
- Recording length
- Selected settings (AI Review adds extra time)
- Current queue size

<Tip>
Live recordings are usually processed quickly since the audio is captured locally.
</Tip>

</Step>

<Step>

Once complete, you can:
- **View** your transcript online
- **Download** in multiple formats: PDF, DOC, TXT, MD, SRT, VTT, CSV, or JSON
- **Share** with team members ([learn more about collaboration](#))
- **Generate summaries** or extract information using templates ([learn about templates](#))

</Step>
</Steps>
