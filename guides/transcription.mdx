## Key Features

### Speaker Diarization

Identify and label different speakers in multi-person conversations.

**When to use:**
- Meetings and conference calls with multiple participants
- Interviews with distinct speakers
- Panel discussions and roundtables
- Podcasts with multiple hosts

**Example output:**
```
Speaker 1: Welcome to today's meeting. Let's start with updates.
Speaker 2: I've completed the project analysis. Here are my findings.
Speaker 1: Excellent. Can you share more details?
```

### Segmentation Styles

Choose how your transcript is broken into segments:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
<Card title="Readable" icon="book">
**~30 second segments** with punctuation and capitalization

Best for documents, meeting notes, and general transcription
</Card>

<Card title="Subtitle" icon="closed-captioning">
**Short, punchy segments** optimized for video captions

Best for video captions, subtitles, and social media content
</Card>
</CardGroup>

## Improving Transcription Quality

### 1. Use High-Quality Audio

Better audio quality leads to more accurate transcriptions:
- Clear speech with minimal background noise
- Good microphone and recording equipment
- Proper audio levels (avoid too quiet or distorted audio)
- Reduce echo and reverb when possible

### 2. Specify the Language

While auto-detect works well, manually specifying the language can improve accuracy:
- **Auto-detect** - Convenient for single-language, clear audio
- **Manual selection** - Better accuracy when you know the language, especially for mixed-language audio, specialized dialects, or consistent processing

<Tip>
For best results, use manual language selection when you know what language is spoken in your audio. See our [Language Support guide](/guides/language-support) for details.

## Best Practices

1. **Test your setup** - Record a short test clip to verify audio quality before long sessions
2. **Choose the right format** - Use readable segments for documents, subtitle segments for videos
3. **Use speaker diarization for conversations** - Makes multi-person transcripts much easier to follow
4. **Review critical transcripts** - Always review transcriptions for business-critical or legal use

## Limitations

Transcription accuracy varies based on audio quality, accents, background noise, and content complexity. For detailed information:

- See [Language Support](/guides/language-support) for language-specific details and accent variations
- Review [Model documentation](/guides/whisper-model) for technical limitations and performance characteristics
