## Overview

Extract transforms your transcripts into structured summaries and insights using AI-powered templates. Instead of reading through entire transcripts, get exactly the information you need in the format you want.

**How it works:**
1. Complete a transcription
2. Select an extraction template
3. AI analyzes your transcript and extracts relevant information
4. Review structured output with source references

## What is Extract?

Extract uses AI to analyze your transcripts and pull out specific information based on templates you choose. Each template defines what information to extract and how to format it.

**Example use cases:**
- Convert meeting recordings into action items and decisions
- Extract key points from interviews
- Generate summaries from lectures or podcasts
- Pull insights from customer calls

2. Click the **document icon** that appears
3. Jump to the exact transcript line with timestamp
