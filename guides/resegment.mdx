## Overview

Resegmenting changes how your transcript is divided without touching the underlying words. Adjust segment length, restructure timing for subtitles, or create longer paragraphs for documents in just a few clicks.

Use resegmentation whenever:

- Segments break mid-sentence or feel too short/long
- You're converting meeting notes into subtitles (or the reverse)
- Different workflows need different timing (podcasts vs. interviews vs. meetings)

<Warning>
Resegmenting overrides your current segment structure. Do it before heavy manual edits or Agent Edit tweaks targeted at specific segments.
</Warning>

## How to resegment

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Agent Edit">
Open a transcript, click the **star icon** to launch Agent Edit (see the [Transcript Editor guide](/guides/transcript-editor#agent-edit) for an overview), then choose **Resegment** under the Transform tab.
</Step>

<Step title="Pick a preset or customize">
Select a preset style, use case, or define your own word/time limits. Click the **configure icon** to adjust settings.
</Step>

<Step title="Preview the structure">
Generate a preview to confirm the new timing and check a few segments with playback.
</Step>

<Step title="Apply the changes">
Accept the new structure to rewrite segment boundaries across the transcript.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Best practices

- **Resegment before editing** – get structure right, then polish text
- **Use playback** – jump to timestamps to confirm the new breaks sound natural
- **Match the output** – subtitles need short clips; documents benefit from paragraphs
- **Duplicate first** – for critical projects, copy the transcript so you can compare versions

## Common workflows

### Create subtitles from meetings

1. Resegment with the **Subtitle** preset  
2. Use [Agent Edit quick fixes](/guides/transcript-editor#agent-edit) (punctuation cleanup, filler-word removal) in the Transcript Editor  
3. Export as SRT or VTT

### Turn podcasts into articles

1. Choose the **Paragraph** preset or set high min/max words  
2. Use [Agent Edit transformations](/guides/transcript-editor#agent-edit) (e.g., rewrite in article tone) inside the Transcript Editor  
3. Export as DOC/MD for publishing

### Clean up messy interviews

1. Resegment with the **Interview** preset to align turns  
2. Enable speaker diarization if not already applied  
3. Use find-and-replace or [Agent Edit custom prompts](/guides/transcript-editor#agent-edit) to standardize speaker names

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
<Accordion title="Does resegmenting change the actual text?">

No. Resegment only alters where timestamps begin and end. The words, punctuation, and speaker labels remain the same.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="What if I don't like the result?">

Use undo or reload the transcript to revert. For important work, duplicate the job before experimenting so you can compare versions.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Can I resegment after translating?">

Yes, but it is best to finalize structure first. Translated transcripts can't run Agent Edit, so resegment prior to translating when possible.

</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Is resegment available through the API?">

Resegmentation currently lives in the dashboard editor. API-based control will be part of a future release.

## What's next

Resegmenting usually happens early in an editing workflow. After you lock in segment timing:

- Open the [Transcript Editor](/guides/transcript-editor) to clean up wording, fix punctuation, or remove filler words using Agent Edit actions explained in that guide
- [Translate your transcript](/guides/translation) once structure and text are final so you can publish in other languages
- [Export](/guides/download-export) formatted subtitles, documents, or structured data files to share with clients or teammates
