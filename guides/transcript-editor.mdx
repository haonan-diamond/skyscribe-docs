## Overview

After your transcription is complete, you can open and edit it using SkyScribe's powerful Transcript Editor. Access your transcriptions from the [**Transcriptions Dashboard**](https://app.sky-scribe.com/transcripts) and click on any completed task to open the editor.

The Transcript Editor combines manual editing capabilities with Agent Edit, allowing you to refine your transcripts quickly and accurately.

## Quick Start Guide

<Tip>
First time using the editor? Follow this quick workflow to get started:
</Tip>

<Steps>
<Step title="Review Segmentation">

</Step>

<Step title="Manual Editing">
Click the **pen icon** to [manually edit](#manual-editing) any segment. Use playback to jump to specific moments and verify accuracy.
</Step>

<Step title="Agent Edit">
Click the **star icon** for [Agent Edit](#agent-edit). Select segments to target specific sections, or apply to the entire transcript. Choose quick actions or custom instructions.
</Step>

<Step title="Review & Accept Changes">
Preview all proposed changes, then accept individually (Y/N keys) or click Accept All.
</Step>
</Steps>

## Editor Interface

When you open a transcription task, you'll see:

- **Transcription Details** - Status, creation date, duration, and creator
- **Transcript Display** - Timestamped segments with speaker labels (if enabled)
- **Playback Controls** - Audio/video player synced with your transcript

Your transcript is displayed with timestamps and speaker labels:

```
0:00 - 0:04
Speaker 0: Welcome to today's meeting.

0:05 - 0:09
Speaker 1: Thanks for joining us. Let's get started.

0:10 - 0:15
Speaker 0: I'd like to begin with project updates.
```

**Playback Navigation:**
Click on any word or phrase in the transcript to jump to that exact moment in the audio/video. This makes it easy to verify accuracy, find specific moments, and identify where segment breaks occur.

**Understanding Segments:**
Each segment is defined by its timestamp range (e.g., 0:00 to 0:04). Segments determine how your transcript is broken into chunks - similar to paragraphs in a document. Different use cases require different segmentation:

- **Subtitles** - Short segments (1-5 seconds) for video captions and social media
- **Sentences** - Balanced segments for general readability and review
- **Paragraphs** - Longer segments for documents, blog posts, and professional content

<Note>
Need different segment timing? Use [**Resegment**](/guides/resegment) to adjust timing with preset styles or custom rules.
</Note>
