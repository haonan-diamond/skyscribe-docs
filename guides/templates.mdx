## Overview

Templates tell the AI what information to extract from your transcripts and how to format it. SkyScribe provides pre-defined templates for common use cases, and you can create custom templates for your specific needs.

## What are Templates?

Templates are instructions that guide AI to:
- Identify relevant information in transcripts
- Structure information in a specific format
- Focus on what matters for your use case

**Think of templates as:**
- A recipe for extracting specific insights
- Instructions for organizing information
- A reusable format for consistent results

## Accessing Templates

Navigate to the **Templates** tab to:
- View all available templates
- Create new templates
- Edit existing templates
- Delete custom templates

<Note>
Pre-defined templates (Executive Summary, Team Meeting, Candidate Interview, Lecture Notes, YouTube Summary) cannot be deleted but can be used as inspiration for custom templates.
</Note>

## Writing Effective Templates

### Template Structure

A well-structured template clearly defines sections and what belongs in each:

```
[Section Name]
- What to extract
- How to format it
- Level of detail

[Another Section]
- Different focus area
- Specific formatting
```

### Example: Sales Call Template

```
Call Overview
Provide a brief summary of the call including the prospect name, company,
and main topics discussed.

Pain Points & Needs
List the key challenges and needs mentioned by the prospect. Include
specific examples they shared.

Product Interest
Outline which products or features the prospect showed interest in and why.

Objections & Concerns
Document any objections, concerns, or hesitations raised during the call.

Next Steps
List all agreed-upon action items with owners and timelines:
• Action item - Owner - Timeline

Opportunity Score (1-10)
Rate the likelihood of closing this deal based on the conversation, with
brief reasoning.
```

## Template Best Practices

### 1. Start with Pre-defined Templates

Use SkyScribe's templates as starting points and modify them for your needs.

### 2. Test and Iterate

Create the template, test it on real transcripts, refine based on results.

### 3. Keep Templates Focused

Better to have multiple specific templates than one that tries to do everything.

### 4. Use Consistent Naming

Name templates clearly so they're easy to find and understand:
- ✅ "Product Demo Follow-up"
- ✅ "Weekly Team Sync Notes"
- ❌ "Template 1"
- ❌ "New Template"

### 5. Document Your Templates

Add context in template names or instructions about when to use them.

### Missing Information

**Problem:** Important details not included in extract

**Solutions:**
