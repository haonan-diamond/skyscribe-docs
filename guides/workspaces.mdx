## Overview

Workspaces let you organize transcripts by team and collaborate with shared access. Everyone in a workspace can:

- View and edit the same transcripts and files
- See transcript ownership and who last updated each file
- Collaborate in real time without copying projects between accounts

Use workspaces to keep client projects, departments, or productions separated while giving teammates the same level of access to everything inside.

## View Your Current Workspace

1. Visit the [Workspaces dashboard](https://app.sky-scribe.com/workspaces)
2. The top of the page shows the name of your current workspace plus the owner and member list
3. Click the workspace name to switch between existing workspaces or create a new one

## Create a Workspace

<Steps>
<Step title="Open Workspace Switcher">
Open the [Workspaces dashboard](https://app.sky-scribe.com/workspaces) and click the workspace name at the top of the page.
</Step>

<Step title="Choose + New Workspace">
Select **+ New Workspace** if you want to start a fresh team space.
</Step>

<Step title="Name the Workspace">
Enter a descriptive name (team, client, production, etc.) and confirm to create it.
</Step>
</Steps>

The new workspace appears in your switcher immediately. All transcripts created while this workspace is active belong to that shared space.

## Invite Team Members

1. Open the workspace dashboard and locate the **Workspace Members** panel
2. Enter a teammate’s email address
3. Send the invite to grant them access to every transcript inside the workspace

Invited members receive an email with instructions to join. Once they accept, they can collaborate on all shared files just like the owner.

## Roles and Permissions

| Role | Permissions |
| --- | --- |
| **Admin** | Manage members (invite/remove), change workspace details, delete teams |
| **Member** | Access and edit all transcripts inside the workspace, view ownership, collaborate with teammates |

Admins automatically inherit all member capabilities plus the ability to manage the team itself. Promote trusted teammates to admin when you need them to help with membership.

## Delete a Workspace

Only admins can delete a workspace.

1. Go to the [Workspaces dashboard](https://app.sky-scribe.com/workspaces)
2. Select the workspace you want to remove
3. Click **Delete Team** and confirm

Deleting a workspace removes shared access for everyone, so export or move important transcripts before confirming.

## Collaborate in Transcriptions

After creating or switching to a workspace, open the [Transcriptions dashboard](https://app.sky-scribe.com/transcriptions). Each transcript shows an **Updated by** indicator so you always know which teammate made the latest changes.

Shared members have the same editing capabilities, so you can use features like the [Transcript Editor](/guides/transcript-editor) together without conflicts.
