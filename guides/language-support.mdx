<Note>
Performance varies based on factors like audio quality, accents, and technical vocabulary. We recommend testing with your specific use case to ensure it meets your needs.
</Note>

## Translation Support

SkyScribe can translate audio between the 99 supported languages.

**How it works:**

1. **Transcription** - Your audio is first transcribed in its original language
2. **Translation** - The transcript is then translated using the model's built-in translation capabilities

## Language Detection

SkyScribe can automatically detect the language spoken in your audio, or you can manually specify the language for better accuracy.

### Auto-Detect

Auto-detect is convenient when you're unsure of the language or processing multiple audio files with different languages.

**Benefits:**
- Saves time - no need to manually specify the language
- Fast and automatic - language is identified as transcription begins
- Works well with clear, single-language audio

### Manual Selection (Recommended for Best Results)

Specifying the language manually provides better accuracy when you know what language is spoken in your audio.

**Choose manual selection when:**
- **You know the language** - Better transcription quality when you specify the exact language
- **Mixed-language audio** - Specify the primary language when audio contains multiple languages
- **Specialized dialects** - Better accuracy for specific regional variants
- **Consistency** - Ensure the same language processing across multiple files
- **Challenging audio** - More reliable when background noise may affect auto-detection

## Accent and Dialect Variations

Our AI model shows improved robustness to diverse accents compared to many existing systems, but performance can vary.

**Strengths:**
- Handles major regional accents well (e.g., American, British, Australian English)
- Better performance with international accents than most specialized models
- Trained on diverse speaker demographics

**Limitations:**

<Note>
The model exhibits disparate performance across different accents, dialects, and demographic groups. Word error rates may be higher for certain speakers.
</Note>

**Factors that can affect accuracy:**
- Regional dialects and non-standard pronunciations
- Speaker demographics (age, gender, ethnicity)
- Code-switching between languages
- Heavy accents or unique speech patterns

## Best Practices for Multilingual Transcription

To get optimal results when transcribing in different languages:

1. **Use high-quality audio** - Clear speech improves accuracy across all languages
2. **Specify the language** manually if auto-detect struggles with your dialect
3. **Review transcripts** for critical applications to ensure accuracy
4. **Report issues** to help us improve support for your language
