## Overview

SkyScribe's translation feature converts spoken audio in one language into written text in another language. This is powered by OpenAI [Whisper](https://openai.com/index/whisper/)'s multilingual capabilities.

**Translation workflow:**
1. Audio is transcribed in its original language
2. The transcript is translated to your target language
3. Optional AI Review polishes the translated text

## Supported Languages

SkyScribe supports translation between any of the **99 supported languages**.

## Improving Translation Quality

### 1. Use AI Review

AI Review enhances translation quality by:
- Fixing mistranslations and awkward phrasing
- Ensuring technical terms are translated correctly
- Improving sentence structure and readability
- Preserving timestamps for subtitle use

<Warning>
AI Review adds 10-20% more processing time but significantly improves translation quality, especially for technical or specialized content.
</Warning>

### 2. Choose High-Quality Audio

Translation quality depends on accurate transcription. Better audio leads to better translations:
- Clear speech with minimal background noise
- Good recording equipment
- Proper audio levels (not too quiet or distorted)

### 3. Specify the Source Language

You can choose to auto-detect the source language or manually specify it for better accuracy:
- **Auto-detect** - Convenient when unsure of the language
- **Manual selection** - Better accuracy when you know the source language, especially for mixed-language audio, specialized dialects, or consistent processing

## Limitations

Translation accuracy varies based on the language pair, audio quality, and content complexity. For detailed information about model limitations and performance:

- See [Language Support](/guides/language-support) for language-specific details
- Review [Model documentation](/guides/whisper-model) for technical limitations

<Note>
We recommend testing translations with your specific content and reviewing output for critical use cases.
</Note>

## Best Practices

1. **Test with your content** - Translation quality varies by language pair and content type
2. **Enable AI Review** - Significantly improves translation quality and readability
3. **Use high-quality audio** - Clear speech produces better transcriptions and translations
4. **Review critical content** - Always review translations for important business or legal use
