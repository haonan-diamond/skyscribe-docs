## Overview

Sales teams spend hours reviewing call recordings and manually taking notes. SkyScribe automates this process, extracting key insights like BANT qualification, objections, competitive mentions, and next steps—so your team can focus on selling.

Automatically extract Budget, Authority, Need, and Timeline from discovery calls.

**What SkyScribe captures:**
- Budget discussions and pricing sensitivity
- Decision-makers and approval process
- Pain points and business needs
- Purchase timeline and urgency

**Example template output:**
```
BUDGET
Mentioned $50K annual budget for sales tools. Currently spending $30K
on existing solution. Willing to invest more for better ROI.

AUTHORITY
Sarah (VP Sales) is the decision-maker. Needs buy-in from CFO for
deals over $40K. IT team involved for technical evaluation.

NEED
Struggling with manual data entry and lack of pipeline visibility.
Lost 2 deals last quarter due to slow follow-up.

TIMELINE
Looking to implement before Q4. Evaluating 3 vendors this month.
Decision expected by end of September.

complexity. Missing forecasting accuracy.
