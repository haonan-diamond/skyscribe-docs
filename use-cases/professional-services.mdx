## Overview

Professional services require accurate, detailed documentation for compliance, quality assurance, and client records. Manual note-taking during client interactions reduces engagement and often misses important details. SkyScribe automatically creates structured documentation so professionals can focus on clients while maintaining comprehensive records.

DEPOSITION DETAILS
Case: Smith v. TechCorp, Inc.
Case Number: CV-2024-8372
Date: September 10, 2024
Time: 10:00 AM - 12:30 PM
Location: Law Offices of Johnson & Associates

PARTICIPANTS
Deponent: Robert Martinez (Former TechCorp Employee)
Plaintiff's Attorney: Jennifer Wong, Esq.
Defense Attorney: Michael Chen, Esq.
Court Reporter: Lisa Anderson

BACKGROUND
Deposition of former TechCorp employee regarding alleged discriminatory
practices in promotion decisions. Deponent worked as Senior Engineer
from 2019-2023, left company after being passed over for promotion.

KEY TESTIMONY

Employment History:
- Hired as Senior Engineer, Level 2 in March 2019
- Received "Exceeds Expectations" on all performance reviews
- Applied for Principal Engineer promotion in 2021, 2022, and 2023
- All three applications denied despite meeting stated criteria
- Resigned in June 2023 after third denial

Promotion Criteria Discussion:
Q: Were you aware of the promotion criteria for Principal Engineer?
A: Yes, it was clearly documented. You needed 4+ years experience,
   lead two major projects, and get "Exceeds Expectations" rating.

Q: Did you meet all three criteria?
A: Yes. I had 4 years experience, led the mobile app rewrite and the
   API v2 migration, and had top ratings every review.

Q: Why do you believe you were denied promotion?
A: The feedback was always vague. "Not quite ready" or "need more time."
   But I met all the written criteria, and junior engineers with less
   experience were promoted.

Critical Admission:
Q: Do you have evidence others were promoted with less experience?
A: Yes. Sarah Chen was promoted to Principal in 2022 after only 3 years.
   She led one major project. I had twice her experience and led more
   projects.

Q: Were there others?
A: Three others promoted in 2022-2023, all with 3 years or less
   experience. All fit a certain demographic pattern.

Manager Communications:
Q: Did your manager explain the denials?
A: In our 1-on-1, he said I was "too aggressive" and needed to be "more
   of a team player." But my performance reviews praised my leadership
   and collaboration.

Q: Did you receive different feedback in written vs. verbal form?
A: Yes. Written reviews were excellent. Verbal feedback for promotion
   was consistently negative about "soft skills" that weren't mentioned
   in reviews.

OBJECTIONS

Defense counsel objected to questions about:
- Other employees' promotion decisions (Overruled - relevant to pattern)
- Manager's personal opinions about deponent (Sustained - speculative)
- Company-wide diversity statistics (Deferred pending discovery)

POTENTIAL INCONSISTENCIES

1. Company claims "objective criteria" but applied inconsistently
2. Performance reviews conflict with promotion denial reasons
3. Less experienced employees promoted while deponent denied

NEXT STEPS
- Request personnel files for Sarah Chen and three other promoted
  engineers for comparison
- Depose deponent's direct manager regarding promotion decisions
- Request company-wide promotion statistics 2019-2023

ATTORNEY NOTES
Strong testimony. Deponent credible and well-prepared. Admission about
specific comparisons to other promoted employees strengthens disparate
treatment claim. Follow up on "demographic pattern" comment in
supplemental discovery.
