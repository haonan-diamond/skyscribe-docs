## Real-World Impact

### Distributed Product Team

**Challenge:** Team across 3 time zones struggled to keep everyone aligned. Meeting notes were inconsistent and action items got lost.

**Solution:** Used SkyScribe's Team Meeting template for all syncs.

**Results:**
- Async team members get full context without attending every meeting
- Action items completion rate increased from 60% to 95%
- Meeting notes published within 5 minutes of ending call
- Historical searchable archive of all team decisions

### Engineering Team

**Challenge:** Daily standups weren't documented, making it hard to track progress or identify recurring blockers.

**Solution:** Recorded standups with SkyScribe's Team Standup template.

**Results:**
- Engineering manager can review standup notes asynchronously
- Identified patterns in blockers (infrastructure issues recurring weekly)
- Remote team members can skip standup and read summary
- Sprint retrospectives backed by actual standup data

## Best Practices

### 1. Use Consistent Templates

Apply the same template to similar meeting types for easier comparison and pattern identification.

### 2. Enable Speaker Diarization

Identify who said what, especially important for action item assignments and decision-making.

### 3. Share Immediately

Post meeting summaries to Slack, Teams, or email while context is fresh.

### 4. Create Tasks from Action Items

Convert extracted action items into Jira, Asana, or Linear tasks with owners and deadlines.

### 5. Build a Meeting Archive

Maintain searchable archives of all team meetings for onboarding and historical reference.
