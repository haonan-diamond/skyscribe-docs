## Overview

Interviewing candidates and conducting user research generates valuable insights—but manual note-taking is inconsistent and time-consuming.

**Example template output:**
```
PARTICIPANT BACKGROUND
Alex Martinez, Marketing Manager at mid-size B2B company (200 employees).
Uses our product daily for campaign analytics. Power user for 2 years.

CURRENT WORKFLOW
Uses our dashboard every morning to review campaign performance. Exports
data to Excel for deeper analysis and executive reporting. Shares
reports with CMO weekly.

PAIN POINTS
"I waste 2 hours every week copying data into Excel because the export
feature doesn't include all the metrics I need."

"The dashboard loads slowly when looking at data older than 90 days.
Sometimes it times out completely."

"I can't compare campaigns side-by-side. I have to open multiple tabs
and manually compare numbers."

DESIRED FEATURES
- Customizable export with all available metrics
- Side-by-side campaign comparison view
- Faster performance for historical data
- Scheduled email reports (weekly summaries)
- Mobile app for checking metrics on the go

NOTABLE QUOTES
"Your product is great for daily monitoring but falls short for strategic
analysis and reporting to executives."

"If you added custom exports and campaign comparison, I'd be willing to
pay 50% more."

KEY INSIGHTS
- Power users need deeper analytics than dashboard provides
- Export functionality is critical but currently insufficient
- Performance with historical data is a major frustration
- Executive reporting is a common use case we don't support well
- Willingness to pay more for advanced features
```
