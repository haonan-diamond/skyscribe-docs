## API Alpha Testing

Our API is currently in alpha testing. Request early access to start building with our transcription API and provide feedback that shapes the product.

Future capabilities will include self-serve key management, scalable async and streaming transcription, and advanced features like speaker diarization, topic tagging, and multilingual support.
